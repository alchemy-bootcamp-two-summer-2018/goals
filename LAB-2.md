# Goals: Layout and Style

Improve your goals app's layout and styling. Try and make your app responsive (mobile and desktop) across all features.

On Mobile, think about:

* Header with Navigation - How will route links be exposed on mobile?
* User goals list and add form - How will the list position itself vs the add form?
* List of all user goals - Does the display need to change for narrower screen size? Or not?

* CSS and HTML code cleanliness and modulear organization **3pts**
